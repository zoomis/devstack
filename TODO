Installation OpenStack Juno in CNC node

1. Download devstack
2. Configure IP address for eth2(guest vm data) and eth3 (public)
3. Configure localrc for controller or compute node with its original IP address

1. Upgrade openvswitch > 2.0
2. Upgrade dhcp agent dnsmasq (from devstack) for only controller node
3. When we use VxLAN, we have to change MTU from 1500 to 1550
